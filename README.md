# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


LIRI takes in four different commands:
    1. 'movie-this' - takes the user's input of a move and returns details of the movie
    2. 'concert-this' - takes the user's input of an artist/band and returns details of their next concert 
    3. 'spotify-this-song' - takes the user's input of a song and returns details of the song
    4. 'do-what-it-says' - uses readFile method to access the random.txt file and pull and execute the command and search
